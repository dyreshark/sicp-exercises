sicp-exercises
==============

My implementations of the exercises from SICP. Used Racket for all the things.
Please note that my Racket library expertise is *seriously* lacking. I have 
a fair bit more experience with Clojure, but I wanted to try using a Scheme, 
so my experience would match what the writers imagined it to be as best as 
possible. (Also I plan on doing lots of these on long transcontinental 
flights, where power outlets may or may not be available, and the JVM
loves sucking the life right out of my laptop's battery.)

I'll probably end up swapping back to Clojure at some point through my
journey, if I don't quit said journey after a few days.

I tried to avoid consulting outside resources as much as possible until
I had an implementation down. If any changes are made after consulting
an outside resource, it will be noted in the file.

Work in progress
----------------

This is a work in progress, meaning I'm still going through the book
as time permits (college is busy). Ideally, I'd like to get through
at least one challenge per day, because apparently they get 
significantly tougher later on in the book (I'm currently sitting at
Chapter 1).
